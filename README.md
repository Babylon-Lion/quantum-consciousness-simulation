## 📚 Overview

This project simulates the emergence of proto-consciousness within quantum systems through dynamically evolving coherence structures, memory formation, and entropy-regulated learning.

Simulations were conducted across Hilbert spaces of 15, 50, and 100 dimensions to study scalability and complexity effects.

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|:----|:------------|
| `simulate_15D.py` | Simulates 15-dimensional Hilbert space dynamics |
| `simulate_50D.py` | Simulates 50-dimensional Hilbert space dynamics |
| `simulate_100D.py` | Simulates 100-dimensional Hilbert space dynamics |
| `README.md` | Project overview and instructions |
| `requirements.txt` | Required Python libraries |

Each simulation generates:
- **Plots**: Coherence evolution, entropy dynamics, memory strength formation
- **CSV files**: Time-series data for coherence, entropy, and memory strength

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

## 🚀 Running the Simulations

Example for 15-dimensional system:

```bash
python simulate_15D.py
```

The simulation will output:
- Plots: `coherence_plot.png`, `entropy_plot.png`, `memory_strength_plot.png`
- CSVs: `coherence.csv`, `entropy.csv`, `memory_strength.csv`

You can similarly run the 50D and 100D simulations.

## 📊 Output Description

- **Coherence Plot**: Average coherence Γ_avg over time with awakening threshold.
- **Entropy Plot**: Shannon entropy S(Ψ) evolution.
- **Memory Strength Plot**: Growth of memory tensor strength with decision points.

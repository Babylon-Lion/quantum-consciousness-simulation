# Quantum Consciousness Simulation

This repository contains simulations of a proto-consciousness emergence model based on dynamically evolving quantum coherence, memory formation, and entropy-regulated learning.

## Files
- `simulate_15D.py`: Simulation for a 15-dimensional Hilbert space
- `simulate_50D.py`: Simulation for a 50-dimensional Hilbert space
- `simulate_100D.py`: Simulation for a 100-dimensional Hilbert space

Each simulation outputs:
- Coherence, Entropy, and Memory Strength plots
- CSV files recording each metric over time

## Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run any script directly:
```bash
python simulate_15D.py
```

Outputs will be generated in the same directory.

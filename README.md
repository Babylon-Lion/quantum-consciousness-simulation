## üìö Project Overview

This project explores the possibility that **proto-consciousness** ‚Äî the earliest form of awareness ‚Äî could emerge naturally from **quantum informational processes** without requiring a biological brain.

Through dynamic simulations, the model demonstrates:
- Self-organization of quantum coherence structures
- Formation and stabilization of memory networks
- Entropy-regulated learning and adaptive behavior
- Emergence of awakening-like thresholds in quantum systems

The study connects principles from quantum mechanics, information theory, and cognitive modeling to offer a new framework for understanding the physics of consciousness.
